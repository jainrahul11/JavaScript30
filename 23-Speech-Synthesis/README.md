# 23 - Speech Synthesis

## About the Project
This project uses *Web Speech API* in which it converts text to speech. There are various things you can control like voice, rate, pitch & text. Then it converts text into speech format.

## Things I learned
- Learned about **Web Speech API** where there are two things `SpeechRecognition` & `SpeechSynthesis`. One recognise the speech of & other read text & tell it to speech.
- `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` Web API. Learned a lot about it. Its various functions that can be used like `text`, `rate`, `pitch`, `voice` & various other useful things.
- `window.speechSynthesis` this has many functions like `speak`, `pause`, `resume`, `cancel` & this is where we put our speechSynthesisUtterance object into. 
- Learned more about the input fields & how to access them & modify them in JavaScript.
- About various voices availale in our browser & how to them.
- If anyone want to understand about then I would suggest [this](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/02/experimenting-with-speechsynthesis/) article. I read it & got the basic understanding of how to use it.

## Some important things
- Made responsive website & make it look aesthically pleasing.
- In `speechSynthesis` it has event called `voicechanged` event that we used to detect that all things loaded.
